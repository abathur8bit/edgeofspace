Living at the Edge of Space is hectic. There are a lot of aliens that try to infuriate our solar system. You and your small team have been tasked keeping the aliens at bay. 

This is another [alphabet challenge](https://coder8bit.itch.io/), the letter **E**. The primary objective here is to make a multiplayer game, like a group made at EAC. It was just being created when I first got a tour of the office, in fact, the networking code was just being worked on. Secondary is to make a single player game that uses the top down space view, and an isometric view using a character template I found on [itch.io](https://intellikat.itch.io/isometric-character-template).
